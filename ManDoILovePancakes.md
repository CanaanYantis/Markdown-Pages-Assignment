# Pancakes
Pancakes are an essential part of the breakfast community
<br>
Back in '08 when Pancakes went throught the divorce from waffles, people thought that he wouldn't be able to bounce back.
<br>
Then BOOM! 
<br>
The 2010 season had Pancake's name written all over it. If you weren't there watching him shine, you missed out. He was sensational.
 To this day I have never seen anything like it.
<br>
I love pancakes.
